\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Multi-window issue:} I had the idea to merge move\_suggest\_code and move\_challenge\_code since they depend on each other. User should be able to move from one window to the next and vice versa.\\
	Decided to have 2 classes in one file. The class objects are instantiated globally and are hidden and shown as means of opening and closing them.
	\item \textbf{Start, Pause and Stop suggestions: }This one was interesting. I created a daemon thread that creates an Event that updates the text display every x seconds. I made it an event so that it would be possible to stop the Event using the Event.set() method to set a flag that the Event will be looking out for. Added new states for the buttons: \texttt{Start} becomes \texttt{Restart} and vice versa, \texttt{Pause} becomes \texttt{Resume} and vice versa, \texttt{Pause} is disabled initially and on \texttt{Stop}.

\textbf{Agenda}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Think about how to tie the windows together. Make it a cohesive application.
	\item Go through the user interface and check to see that all buttons do what they are supposed to do. 
	\item Look for inspiration to make the app look a little bit better.
